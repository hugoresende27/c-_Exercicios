/*
Write a program that uses a Template such that there are functions called GetSmallestValue  and GetLargestValue.These types 
should work with int, double, and string. 
Ask the user to enter 5 integers and it should call GetSmallestValue and GetLargestValue. Have each function return the smallest 
value in the array, and the largest one.
Then ask the user to enter 5 double values. Do the same thing as above, calling the same function GetSmallestValue with the 
double array, and also call the same function GetLargestValue with the double array.
Lastly, ask the user to enter 5 string values and store them in an array of strings.
Call the same function, GetSmallestValue with the string array, and also call the same function, GetLargestValue, to get the 
largest string in the array and display them.
